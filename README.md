*Get info on any IP easily! (Way To Easy)*

# ❓How To❓
*Bro your dumb if you dont know how ngl, just paste an IP into the cmd/console (depends on what you are using) and boom info!
If it is an invalid IP it wont work and that sucks for you tbh. All you need is a valid IP and you are ok.*

# 🔒Requirements🔒
*You may have to run 'pip install requests' or any other way you want to install requests for this to work.*
*Certain IDEs like replit will import request automatically so you dont have to worry!*
